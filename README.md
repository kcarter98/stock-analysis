# Refactoring Stock Analysis Code

## Overview

In this analysis, it was asked whether or not it is beneficial to refactor code, and if it is beneficial then how beneficial is it? Here I coded a script in VBA that looked at a list of stock information and turned the data into a readable way to analyze stock performance. After coding the inital script, I took extra time to improve it in an attempt to make it faster and more efficient.

## Results

### Change from Refactor

After refactoring the code, it was clear after it was ran how advantageous it was over the original first attempt in both the 2017 and 2018 runs. As you can see below, the original code took over 40 seconds and it was easy to tell that excel was struggling with the "not responding" message, but after a while it would pull through.
